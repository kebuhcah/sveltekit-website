## Intro

I've been studying various dialects of Arabic on-and-off for about 15 years now, and modern Hebrew for around 10. More recently, I've taken a few stabs at learning other less well-known Semitic languages like Aramaic (mainly Syriac) and the various languages of Ethiopia - mainly Amharic but also a little Ge'ez and a tiny amount of Tigrinya.

I'm still far from conversational in Amharic, but at this point I am able to read the alphabet quite well and have a good grasp of the grammar. Since Amharic is much less studied than either Arabic or Hebrew, I've occasionally been asked to explain just how similar it really is to its more famous relatives. This post is basically a cheat-sheet for the next time I'm in that situation.

(Note: this article will be most enjoyable if you have at least A2 knowledge of Arabic or Hebrew. [Wikipedia Link])

## What's in a name?

Let's start with some Amharic words you're somewhat likely to have heard, even if you didn't know what Amharic was.

**Addis Ababa**, the capital of Ethiopia, means "New Flower". <Lemma language="amh" latin="Addis" script="አዲስ"/> is related to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="ḥadaš" latin2="chadash" script="חדש" /> and Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḥadīṯ" script="حديث"/>. 

(Additionally, <Lemma language="amh" latin="Ababa" script="አበባ" /> is related to Syriac <Lemma language="syc" latin="habbāḇā" script="ܗܒܒܐ" />, which is another example of h-dropping. There aren't any related Arabic or Hebrew words as far as I know.)

The name of Ethiopia's last emperor (and Rastafarian icon) **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie" target="_blank">Haile Selassie</a>**, meanwhile, means "Power of the Trinity".  <Lemma language="amh" latin="Selassie" script="ሥላሴ"/> is related to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="šaloš" latin2="shalosh" script="שלוש" /> and Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṯalāṯa" script="ثلاثة"/>. Strictly speaking, I guess this should be considered a Ge'ez word, but it exhibits the same sound change as in Amharic — the Arabic "th" sound, which corresponds to Hebrew "sh", becomes an "s" in Amharic.

Now let's take a look some more example. Many of these are words I remembered during my own learning process, but I also owe a lot of this content to D.L. Appleyard's <a href="https://archive.org/details/AppleyardAComparativeApproachToTheAmharicLexicon1977" target="_blank">A Comparative Approach to the Amharic Lexicon (1977)</a>.

## Obviously similar words
- <Lemma language="amh" latin="bet" script="ቤት"/> ("house") is clearly related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="bayt" script="بيت"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="bayit" script="בית"/>
- <Lemma language="amh" latin="bal" script="ባል"/> <Lemma language="ara" latin="baʕl" script="بعل"/> <Lemma language="heb" latin="ba'al" script="בעל"/>
