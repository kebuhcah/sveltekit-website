## Intro

<section>
I've been studying various dialects of Arabic on-and-off for about 15 years now, and modern Hebrew for around 10. More recently, I've taken a few stabs at learning other less widely studied Semitic languages like <a href="https://medium.com/sunlanguagetheories/dabbling-diary-aramaic-the-first-world-language-f7477e014bdf" target="_blank">Aramaic</a> and various languages of Ethiopia* - mostly Amharic but also a little Ge'ez and a tiny amount of Tigrinya.

I'm still far from conversational in Amharic, but at this point I am able to read the alphabet quite well and have a good grasp of the grammar. Since Amharic is much less studied than either Arabic or Hebrew, I've occasionally been asked to explain just how similar it really is to its more famous relatives. This post is basically a cheat-sheet for the next time I'm in that situation.


(Note: this article will be most enjoyable if you have at least A2 knowledge of Arabic or Hebrew. [Wikipedia Link])

## What's in a name?
<section>

Let's start with some Amharic words you're somewhat likely to have heard, even if you didn't know what Amharic was.

<aside class="right"><Lemma language="amh" latin="Abäba" script="አበባ" /> is also related to Syriac <Lemma language="syc" latin="habbāḇā" script="ܗܒܒܐ" punct />, which is another example of h&#8209;dropping. There aren't any related Arabic or Hebrew words as far as I know.</aside>

**Addis Ababa**, the capital of Ethiopia, means "New Flower". <Lemma language="amh" latin="Addis" script="አዲስ"/> is related to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="ḥadaš" latin2="chadash" script="חדש" /> and Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḥadīṯ" script="حديث" punct />. 

The name of Ethiopia's last emperor (and Rastafarian icon) **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie" target="_blank">Haile Selassie</a>**, meanwhile, means "Power of the Trinity".  <Lemma language="amh" latin="Səllasé" script="ሥላሴ"/> is related to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="šaloš" latin2="shalosh" script="שלוש" /> and Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṯalāṯa" script="ثلاثة" punct/>. Strictly speaking, I guess this should be considered a Ge'ez word, but it exhibits the same sound change as in Amharic — the Arabic "th" sound, which corresponds to Hebrew "sh", becomes an "s" in Amharic.
</section>


Now let's take a look some more examples. Many of these are words I remembered during my own learning process, but I also owe a lot of this content to D.L. Appleyard's <a href="https://archive.org/details/AppleyardAComparativeApproachToTheAmharicLexicon1977" target="_blank">A Comparative Approach to the Amharic Lexicon (1977)</a>.

## "Obvious" cognates

Many common words in Amharic, Arabic and Hebrew are related to each other in a straightforward way, without much change in meaning or weird sound changes:

- "House" in Amharic is <Lemma language="amh" latin="bet" script="ቤት" punct/>, which is clearly related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="bayt" script="بيت"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="bayit" script="בית"/>
- The Amharic word for "husband", "owner" or "master", <Lemma language="amh" latin="bal" script="ባል" punct/>, is related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="baʕl" script="بعل"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="ba'al" script="בעל"/> (and the ancient Levantine deity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal" target="_blank">Baal</a>)
- "World", <Lemma language="amh" latin="aläm" script="ዓለም" punct />, corresponds to <Lemma language="ara" latin="ʕālam" script="عالم"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="olam" script="עולם"/> 
- "Star" is <Lemma language="amh" latin="kokäb" script="ኮከብ" punct />, related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="kawkab" script="كوكب"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="kokhav" script="כוכב"/> (although the Arabic word more commonly means "planet" now).
- "Sky" is <Lemma language="amh" latin="sämay" script="ሰማይ" punct />, related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="samāʔ" script="سماء"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shamayim" script="שמים"/>
- We saw that the root for "three"/"trinity" is similar in the three languages earlier, and most other numbers are related too, which is clearest when you look at the multiples of ten: 
  - 10 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="assər" script="ዐሥር" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ʕašara" script="عشرة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="esre" script="עשרה"/>
  - 40 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="arba" script="አርባ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ʔarbaʕa" script="أربعة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="arba'a" script="ארבעה"/>
  - 50 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="amsa" script="አምሳ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḵamsa" script="خمسة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="khamisha" script="חמישה"/>
  - 60 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="səlsa" script="ሥልሳ" punct />, sort of like <Lemma language="ara" latin="sitta" script="ستة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shisha" script="שישה"/> (the original root was probably <em>s-d-s</em>)
  - 70 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="säba" script="ሰባ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="sabʕa" script="سبعة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shiv'a" script="שבעה"/>
  - 80 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="sämanya" script="ሰማንያ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṯamāniya" script="ثمانية"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shmona" script="שמונה"/>
  - meanwhile the words for 2, 20, 9 and 90 (<Lemma language="amh" latin="hulätt" script="ሁለት" punct />, <Lemma language="amh" latin="haya" script="ሀያ" punct />, <Lemma language="amh" latin="zäṭäññ" script="ዘጠኝ" /> and <Lemma language="amh" latin="zäṭäna" script="ዘጠና" />) come from unrelated roots

## Different meanings

Then again, there are also plenty of cases where the meanings of words have drifted in different directions in different languages.

- The root *l-ḥ-m*, which came to mean "meat" in Arabic (<Lemma language="ara" latin="laḥm" script="لحم" punct />) but "bread" in Hebrew (<Lemma language="heb" latin="lékhem" script="לחם" punct />), means "cow" in Amharic (<Lemma language="amh" latin="lam" script="ላም" punct />, again with dropping of the *h* sound)
- The Amharic verb meaning "to eat", <Lemma language="amh" latin="bäla" script="በላ" punct />, comes from the same root as the Arabic and Hebrew for "to swallow" - <Lemma language="ara" latin="balaʕa" script="بلع" /> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="bala'" script="בלע" />
- <Lemma language="amh" latin="həzb" script="ሕዝብ" punct />, which means "people" or "crowd" in Amharic (and also "nation" or "tribe" in Ge'ez), is related to Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḥizb" script="حزب" /> which now mainly means "political party" (as in <em>Hezbollah</em>, "Party of God")
- One of the Amharic words for "god", <Lemma language="amh" latin="ämlak" script="አምላክ" punct />, shares the same <em>m-l-k</em> root with <Lemma language="ara" latin="malik" script="ملک" /> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="mélekh" script="מלך" punct />, which both mean "king"
- The proto-Semitic word for "wolf", which produced Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḏiʔb" script="ذئب" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="z'ev" script="זאב" punct />, ended up meaning "hyena" in Amharic instead: <Lemma language="amh" latin="ǧəb" script="ጅብ" punct />, likely due to it being the more common wolf-like animal in the area

## Sound changes

That last example above may have given you pause - wait, the *ǧ* in Amharic ("j" as in "joker", /d͡ʒ/ for real IPA-heads) is related to Arabic *dh* ("th" in "this", i.e. /ð/) and Hebrew *z*? 

That's right. What probably happened is that an original *dh* sound - which became *z* in Hebrew, *d* in Aramaic, and stayed the same in Arabic - first became a *d* in Amharic and at some point softened to a *j* sound (like in Brazilian Portuguese, for example).

<section>

There's a lot more where that came from:

- <Lemma language="amh" latin="əǧǧ" script="እጅ" punct />, the Amharic word for "hand", also shows the softening of the final <em>d</em> that was preserved in Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="yad" script="يد" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="yad" script="יד" />
- <Lemma language="amh" latin="ləǧǧ" script="ልጅ" punct />, meaning "boy/son/child", has a similar relationship to <Lemma language="ara" latin="walad" script="ولد" /> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="yeled" script="ילד" punct />, but also dropping the <em>w/y</em> at the beginning
<aside class="right"><Lemma language="amh" latin="wär" script="ወር" punct />/<Lemma language="heb" latin="yaréakh" script="ירח" /> is possibly also related to the Arabic word for "history", <Lemma language="ara" latin="tārīḵ" script="تاريخ" /> (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/تاريخ#Etymology" target="_blank">Wiktionary</a>)</aside>
- Speaking of the proto-Semitic <em>w</em> which became <em>y</em> in Hebrew: that sound change also explains how <Lemma language="amh" latin="wär" script="ወር" /> ("month") corresponds to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="yaréakh" script="ירח" /> ("moon")
- Just like the <em>d</em> sound, <em>t</em> can also soften to a <em>č</em>, which is how you can tell that the Amharic word for "under", <Lemma language="amh" latin="tač" script="ታች" punct />, comes from the same root as Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="taḥt" script="تحت" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="tákhat" script="תחת" />
- Another tricky sound change is that some emphatic consonants merged in Amharic (but not Ge'ez), so for example the Amharic <Lemma language="amh" latin="ṭ" script="ጥ" /> sound sometimes corresponds to an Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṣ" script="ص" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="ts" script="צ" punct />. This is how you get cognate pairs like Amharic <Lemma language="amh" latin="wäṭa" script="ወጣ" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="yatsa" script="יצא" punct />, which both mean "to go out" (again with the w/y switch)
- Another such pair is Amharic <Lemma language="amh" latin="mäṭa" script="መጣ" /> ("to come") and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="matsa" script="מצא" /> ("to find"), which you can tell are related despite the difference in meaning
- For an Amharic vs. Arabic example, we have <Lemma language="amh" latin="ṭwat" script="ጡዋት" punct /> and <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṣabāḥ" script="صباح" punct />, both meaning "morning". There's a lot going on here besides the <em>ṭ/ṣ</em> switch too - an original <em>b</em> became <em>w</em> in Amharic, and then a <em>t</em> was inserted to replace the missing <em>h</em> (not that strange when you consider t/h alternations that appear in Arabic and Hebrew)

</section>

## Loans and mutual influences

In a few cases, rather than descending from the same root, Amharic (or Ge'ez) borrowed words directly from other Semitic languages. In the early days this would have been mostly from Aramaic, and more recently the influence of Arabic has been stronger. There also seem to be instances of influence going the other way.

- The Amharic word for "religion", <Lemma language="amh" latin="haymanot" script="ሃይማኖት" punct />, is a loan from Syriac <Lemma language="syc" latin="haymānūṯā" script="ܗܝܡܢܘܬܐ" punct />, which means "faith", as do its cognates <Lemma language="ara" latin="īmān" script="إيمان" /> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="emuna" script="אמונה" />
- <Lemma language="amh" latin="gänzäb" script="ገንዘብ" /> ("money") ultimately comes from an Old Iranian word <em>*ganza</em> ("treasure"), likely via Syriac <Lemma language="syc" latin="ganzā" script="ܓܢܙܐ" /> (later <Lemma language="syc" latin="gazzā" script="ܓܙܐ" punct/>) and also related to Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="kanz" script="كنز" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="g'nazim" script="גנזים" punct />, not to mention Hungarian <em>kincs</em> and Spanish <em>alcancía</em> ("cashbox")
- The Amharic (and Ge'ez) word for "book", <Lemma language="amh" latin="mäṣḥaf" script="መጽሐፍ" punct />, was actually borrowed from <em>from</em> Ethiopia <em>into</em> Arabic as <Lemma language="ara" latin="muṣḥaf" script="مصحف" /> (at least, according to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/مصحف#Arabic" target="_blank">Wiktionary</a>). That then became the source for words like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṣaḥāfa" script="صحافة" /> ("journalism") and <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṣaḥāfī" script="صحافي" /> ("journalist"). And in Amharic, <Lemma language="amh" latin="ṣäḥafi" script="ጸሓፊ" /> means "writer" or "scribe"
- In another intriguing case, the Arabic word <Lemma language="ara" latin="minbar" script="منبر" /> (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minbar" target="_blank">a pulpit in a mosque</a>) may also have an Ethiopic origin, via the verb <Lemma language="amh" latin="näbbärä" script="ነበረ" /> which originally meant "to sit" but now also means "to stay", "to live" or just the auxiliary verb "to be". That would make it a relative of the Amharic word for "chair", <Lemma language="amh" latin="wämbär" script="ወምበር" punct />, where the initial <em>m</em> became a <em>w</em> due to nasal dissimilation. (See the references in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/منبر#Arabic" target="_blank">Wiktionary</a> for the sources of this claim.)

## Final notes

<section>
<aside class="right">*But certainly much closer than languages in other branches of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages" target="_blank">Afroasiatic language family</a> like Somali, Oromo, Hausa or Berber.</aside>

So there you have it, about what you might expect from a somewhat distant relative* of Arabic and Hebrew, with obvious signs of shared origins but also plenty of differences from thousands of years of separation — and with a dash of mutual cultural influence to top it off.

At some point I'll be putting together some notes on how the *grammar* of Amharic compares to Arabic and Hebrew as well, and there'll be a similar mix of parallels and divergences there too. Thanks for reading!
