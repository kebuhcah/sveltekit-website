## Intro

I've been studying various dialects of Arabic on-and-off for about 15 years now, and modern Hebrew for around 10. More recently, I've taken a few stabs at learning other less well-known Semitic languages like Aramaic (mainly Syriac) and the various languages of Ethiopia - mainly Amharic but also a little Ge'ez and a tiny amount of Tigrinya.

I'm still far from conversational in Amharic, but at this point I am able to read the alphabet quite well and have a good grasp of the grammar. Since Amharic is much less studied than either Arabic or Hebrew, I've occasionally been asked to explain just how similar it really is to its more famous relatives. This post is basically a cheat-sheet for the next time I'm in that situation.

(Note: this article will be most enjoyable if you have at least A2 knowledge of Arabic or Hebrew. [Wikipedia Link])

## What's in a name?
<section>

Let's start with some Amharic words you're somewhat likely to have heard, even if you didn't know what Amharic was.

<aside class="right">Additionally, <Lemma language="amh" latin="Abäba" script="አበባ" /> is related to Syriac <Lemma language="syc" latin="habbāḇā" script="ܗܒܒܐ" punct />, which is another example of h-dropping. There aren't any related Arabic or Hebrew words as far as I know.</aside>

**Addis Ababa**, the capital of Ethiopia, means "New Flower". <Lemma language="amh" latin="Addis" script="አዲስ"/> is related to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="ḥadaš" latin2="chadash" script="חדש" /> and Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḥadīṯ" script="حديث" punct />. 

The name of Ethiopia's last emperor (and Rastafarian icon) **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie" target="_blank">Haile Selassie</a>**, meanwhile, means "Power of the Trinity".  <Lemma language="amh" latin="Səllasé" script="ሥላሴ"/> is related to Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="šaloš" latin2="shalosh" script="שלוש" /> and Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṯalāṯa" script="ثلاثة" punct/>. Strictly speaking, I guess this should be considered a Ge'ez word, but it exhibits the same sound change as in Amharic — the Arabic "th" sound, which corresponds to Hebrew "sh", becomes an "s" in Amharic.

</section>


Now let's take a look some more examples. Many of these are words I remembered during my own learning process, but I also owe a lot of this content to D.L. Appleyard's <a href="https://archive.org/details/AppleyardAComparativeApproachToTheAmharicLexicon1977" target="_blank">A Comparative Approach to the Amharic Lexicon (1977)</a>.

## "Obvious" cognates

Many common words in Amharic, Arabic and Hebrew are related to each other in a straightforward way, without much change in meaning or particularly weird sound changes:

- "House" in Amharic is <Lemma language="amh" latin="bet" script="ቤት" punct/>, which is clearly related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="bayt" script="بيت"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="bayit" script="בית"/>
- The Amharic word for "husband", "owner" or "master", <Lemma language="amh" latin="bal" script="ባል" punct/>, is related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="baʕl" script="بعل"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="ba'al" script="בעל"/> (and the ancient Levantine deity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal" target="_blank">Baal</a>)
- "World", <Lemma language="amh" latin="aläm" script="ዓለም" punct />, corresponds to <Lemma language="ara" latin="ʕālam" script="عالم"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="olam" script="עולם"/> 
- "Star" is <Lemma language="amh" latin="kokäb" script="ኮከብ" punct />, related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="kawkab" script="كوكب"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="kokhav" script="כוכב"/> (although the Arabic word more commonly means "planet" now).
- "Sky" is <Lemma language="amh" latin="sämay" script="ሰማይ" punct />, related to <Lemma language="ara" latin="samāʔ" script="سماء"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shamayim" script="שמים"/>
- We saw that the root for "three"/"trinity" is similar in the three languages earlier, and most other numbersare related too, although this is clearer in the multiples of ten: 
  - 10 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="assər" script="ዐሥር" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ʕašara" script="عشرة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="esre" script="עשרה"/>
  - 40 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="arba" script="አርባ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ʔarbaʕa" script="أربعة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="arba'a" script="ארבעה"/>
  - 50 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="amsa" script="አምሳ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḵamsa" script="خمسة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="khamisha" script="חמישה"/>
  - 60 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="səlsa" script="ሥልሳ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="sitta" script="ستة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shisha" script="שישה"/>
  - 70 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="säba" script="ሰባ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="sabʕa" script="سبعة"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shiv'a" script="שבעה"/>
  - 80 is <Lemma language="amh" latin="sämanya" script="ሰማንያ" punct />, like <Lemma language="ara" latin="ṯamāniya" script="ثمانية"/> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="shmona" script="שמונה"/>
  - 2, 20, 9 and 90 (<Lemma language="amh" latin="hulätt" script="ሁለት" punct />, <Lemma language="amh" latin="haya" script="ሀያ" punct />, <Lemma language="amh" latin="zäṭäññ" script="ዘጠኝ" /> and <Lemma language="amh" latin="zäṭäna" script="ዘጠና" />) come from unrelated roots

## Different meanings

Then again, there are also plenty of cases where the meanings of words have drifted in different directions in different languages.

- The root *l-ḥ-m*, which came to mean "meat" in Arabic (<Lemma language="ara" latin="laḥm" script="لحم" punct />) but "bread" in Hebrew (<Lemma language="heb" latin="lekhem" script="לחם" punct />), means "cow" in Amharic (<Lemma language="amh" latin="lam" script="ላም" punct />, again with dropping of the *h* sound)
- The Amharic verb meaning "to eat", <Lemma language="amh" latin="bäla" script="በላ" punct />, comes from the same root as the Arabic and Hebrew for "to swallow" - <Lemma language="ara" latin="balaʕa" script="بلع" /> and <Lemma language="heb" latin="bala'" script="בלע" />
- hezb (people)
- amlak
- The proto-Semitic word for "wolf", which produced Arabic <Lemma language="ara" latin="ḏiʔb" script="ذئب" /> and Hebrew <Lemma language="heb" latin="z'ev" script="זאב" punct />, ended up meaning "hyena" in Amharic instead: <Lemma language="amh" latin="ǧəb" script="ጅብ" punct />, likely due to it being the more common wolf-like animal in the area

## Sound changes

The last example above may have given you pause for a second - wait, the *ǧ* in Amharic ("j" as in "joker", /d͡ʒ/ for real IPA-heads) is related to Arabic *dh* ("th" in "this", /ð/) and Hebrew *z*? What probably happened is that an original *dh* sound - which became *z* in Hebrew, *d* in Aramaic, and stayed the same in Arabic - first became a *d* in Amharic and at some point softened to a *j* sound (like in Brazilian Portuguese, for example).

And there's a lot more where that came from:

- leg (child)
- tach (under)
- war (moon)
- wata (exit), mata (find)
- twat (morning)

## Loans and mutual influences

In a few cases, rather than descending from the same root, Amharic (or Ge'ez) borrowed words directly from other Semitic languages. In the early days this would have been mostly from Aramaic, and more recently the influence of Arabic has been stronger. There also seem to be instances of influence going the other way.
