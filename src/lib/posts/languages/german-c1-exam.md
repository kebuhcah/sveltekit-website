excerpt: Some notes on how I prepped for my German C1 exam, and what it means for my overall language learning situation.
---

Last October, I finally went and took an official test to certify my skill in a foreign language. This was a long time coming, since I'd decided way back in 2021 that I would like to do an official language exam in one language, and pretty quickly settled on German as the language to do it in. But still, it took me a while to decide on the specific timing of the exam, and I finally felt reasonably confident in my ability to pass the C1 exam last summer. (This was shortly after I'd finally gotten around to actually visiting Germany for once — I hung out in Berlin for a week after last year's Polyglot Gathering in May.)

## What the test was like

Conveniently, there's a Goethe Institut here in Los Angeles that offers exams in various levels a couple times a year. I figured that with the low frequency of exams, I'd be taking the test with a few other people, especially since I'd been warned that the exam might be cancelled if not enough people signed up. But on the day of the exam, I found out that I was literally the only person to sign up for the C1 test last fall (although one other people was there for to do a portion of the B1 test). This made things a bit awkward for the final speaking segment of the exam, because you're usually supposed to be paired up with one of the other people taking the test — instead, I just had to speak with one of the staff members.

The test was pretty standard, with reading, writing, listening and speaking segments as you can see describe on the <a href="https://bfu.goethe.de/c1mod/" target="_blank">Goethe Institut website</a>. The one thing that threw me off a bit was that the whole thing was to do be done *by hand* with a pencil on paper — I knew that was a possibility, but guessed that a computed-based exam would be more likely. This was the most the most I'd written by hand in a single sitting in any languages in *years*, and actually the first time I'd ever written *anything* by hand in German beyond a couple of words. This made the writing section a bit more stressful that it would've been otherwise, and also made the first listening segment a bit more challenging since you only hear the recording a single time and have to write down long-ish answers by hand. 

In the end, I guess that bit of extra stress didn't really matter. Coming out of the exam, I gave myself a roughly 70% chance of even passing - depending on how badly the writing went - but a week later I was notified that the actual score I got was 97 out of 100: 25/25 on listening, and 24/25 on each of the other segments. (I must say, there must have been some sort of grading curve, because I know for a fact that I missed at least one of the listening questions.)


## Preparation

Of course, the first order of business when it comes to prepping for a test is finding out what the format of the test will be.

I also skimmed the sample tests on the Goethe Institut website, which helped me decide that B2 seemed a bit too easy, C2 a bit too hard, and that C1 would be slightly challenging but certainly acheivable.

Next, I came across this very helpful manual with useful vocabulary and turns of phrase to use *specifically* in the exam.

Beyond exam-specific preparations, I decided I also needed to finally clarify my understanding of a few grammar points which I could get away with not knowing in casual conversation, but which would be problematic when writing an essay.

Another big focus was learning not just words, but word collocations and synonym groups.

I also kept reading a lot of German books, as I had already been doing for the past two years. Around the time of the exam, the main book I was reading was a German translation of Frank Herbert's Dune, which I had decided to read in anticipation of the release of Dune 2 (which was originally scheduled for last fall before being delayed to this year because of the actors' strike).

## What does C1 even mean?

As a self-taught language learner for the most part (for all my foreign languages except Russian), I've always struggled a bit with assessing my own language level. On the one hand, that's totally fine - I've never actually needed an official language certificate for work or study, and despite having thought about it occasionally in the past I don't have any plans to (formally) study or work abroad. (The privilege that comes with being an L1 English (and Chinese) speaker I suppose.) On the other hand, being able to quantify things is often helpful, at the very least for setting goals and tracking progress, and to know what order to put my languages in at polyglot events.

In the past, I've had people tell me my Spanish is B2 (or even that my Slovak was B2 at one point), and I've been satisfied with that - if my skill in a language is roughly on par with my Spanish, that's B2. (It also has the benefit of sounding somewhat impressive but not presumptuous.)

Another issue is that my perception of language ability is skewed by my tendency to focus on reading and listening far more than speaking, and with absolutely no focus on writing at all. And when I read German these days, it tends to be top-tier content produced by proficient writers at the peak of their craft - so whenever I read their writing, I think to myself "wow, I could never phrase things so eloquently", but that's probably not the right way to go about assessing language ability.

## What's next?

One obvious question that comes to mind is "when are you going to take the C2?" to which I have to say, I have no idea right now. Prior to taking the C1 test, I would have considered C2 to be an entirely unrealistic goal unless I literally moved to a German speaking country for several year. But with the decent score I got on the C1, and considering that you only really need 60% to pass a text, I'd say it no longer seems entirely ridiculous.

At the very least, it's nice to have a solid benchmark against which I can judge my skill level in other languages.
