excerpt: Some notes on how I prepped for my German C1 exam, and what it means for my overall language learning situation.
---

Last October, I finally went and took an official test to certify my skill in a foreign language. This was a long time coming, as I had decided way back in 2021 that I would like to finally do that in at least one language, and soon after settled on German as the language to do it in. But still, I didn't fully decide on the specific timing of the exam until last summer, once I felt reasonably confident in my ability to pass the C1 exam. 

# What the test was like

Get this: I was literally the only person to sign up for the C1 German exam at the LA Goethe Institute (which serves the entire Southern California region) last fall. This made things a bit awkward for the final speaking segment of the exam, because you're usually supposed to be paired up with one of the other people taking the test, and in this case there just wasn't anyone.

I also kept reading a lot of German books, as I had already been doing for the past two years. Around the time of the exam, the main book I was reading was a German translation of Frank Herbert's Dune.

# What does C1 even mean?

The Institut managed to get my score back to me pretty quick, since I was the only person they had to grade. ðŸ˜‚ Add the end of the exam, I gave myself a roughly 70% chance of passing - depending on how badly the writing went - and the actual score I got was 97 out of 100. ðŸ˜±

# What's next?

One obvious question that comes to mind is "when are you going to take the C2?" to which I have to say, I have no idea right now. I don't really have any plans to go to Germany for work or study at present, so a C2 certificate would be even more pointless than a C1. On the other hand, I have to say I am a bit curious.
