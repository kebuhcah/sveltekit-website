excerpt: So I decided to make my own website - but why?
---

Welcome to "Sun Language Theories", my new website. I had previously been posting language related thoughts on and off to a Medium blog of the same name for several years, but it's been a while since I've posted anything there (the last article was in early 2022), and I've decided to try a different approach this time by building my own site from scratch.

# Motivation

But why? Isn't it a lot easier to just use an existing platform to post things on, and let the platform handle everything from editing and layout to distribution? Probably. But from the couple of years I'd been writing on my blog - with long breaks in between - I kept running into a recurring issue: writing a whole article takes a long time. The cycle of collecting a bunch of thoughts, laying them out in a long string of words, and then publishing them in finished form once and for all, just didn't quite fit my style.

Like, I'm thinking about languages and learning languages all the time. If you follow me on social media, you'll have seen the regular stream of short random linguistics findings and random thoughts I've been having on a consistent basis. But these aren't generally the kinds of things that would make sense to write a whole article on. On the other hand, social media posts are a bit *too* transient - you can enjoy them for maybe a day, and then they're flooded out of your feed by endless new content. Sure you can search for individual old posts, but the discoverability of past content isn't the best if you're just looking for various things within a given topic.

Another reason I wanted to try making a website is just because I can. I work in tech, and although my day job mainly involves data analysis rather than app or web development, I have dabbled in some of the relevant technologies over the years. Having a long-running project to work on seems like a good way to keep up those skills and learn new things about how the web works.

# Technical Notes

This website is built using SvelteKit and Vercel. To start off, I made use of a couple of blog templates: https://vercel.com/templates/svelte/sveltekit-boilerplate and https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter/tree/main. 

Why Svelte? In fact, the main web development framework I've used in the past has been React, but a few months ago I came across an article that praised the virtues of Svelete, and I have to say I was intrigued. I don't think I've experienced either of these frameworks extensively enough yet to say that one is definitely better than the other, but so far working with Svelte has felt refreshing simple for the most part.
